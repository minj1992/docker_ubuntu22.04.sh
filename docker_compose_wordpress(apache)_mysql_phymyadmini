Simple Explanation
MySQL Service (my_database):

Uses the official MySQL image.
Sets up environment variables for MySQL root password, database name, user, and user password.
Persists MySQL data in a named volume called mysql.
WordPress Service (wordpress):

Uses the latest WordPress image.
Depends on the MySQL service (my_database) to be up and running.
Maps port 8000 on the host to port 80 in the container.
Sets environment variables to connect WordPress to the MySQL database.
Mounts a local directory ./wordpress to the containerâ€™s /var/www/html directory for persistence and access to WordPress files.
phpMyAdmin Service (phpmyadmin):

Uses the official phpMyAdmin image.
Depends on the MySQL service (my_database) to be up and running.
Maps port 8080 on the host to port 80 in the container.
Sets environment variables to connect phpMyAdmin to the MySQL database.
Volumes:

Defines a named volume mysql to persist MySQL data.

Workflow:
The docker-compose command starts all the services defined in the docker-compose.yaml file.
The MySQL container (my_database) starts and sets up the database with the provided credentials and database name.
The WordPress container (wordpress) starts after the MySQL container is ready, connects to the MySQL database using the provided credentials, and makes WordPress accessible on port 8000.
The phpMyAdmin container (phpmyadmin) starts, connects to the MySQL database using the provided credentials, and makes phpMyAdmin accessible on port 8080 for database management.

command to execute docker-compose.yaml and stat stop and destroy 
ChatGPT
Here are the commands to execute, start, stop, and destroy your Docker Compose setup using the docker-compose.yaml file.

Command to Execute Docker Compose
Navigate to the directory containing your docker-compose.yaml file and run:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d
This command starts the services defined in the docker-compose.yaml file in detached mode (running in the background).
Command to Start Docker Compose Services
If the services have been previously stopped and you want to start them again, use:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose start
This command starts the existing containers for a service that were stopped.
Command to Stop Docker Compose Services
To stop the services without removing the containers, use:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose stop
This stops the running containers but keeps them around for future use.
Command to Destroy Docker Compose Setup
To stop and remove all the containers, networks, and volumes defined in your docker-compose.yaml, use:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down -v
The -v flag removes the named volumes declared in the volumes section of the docker-compose.yaml file.
Summary
Execute: docker-compose up -d
Start: docker-compose start
Stop: docker-compose stop
Destroy: docker-compose down -v
